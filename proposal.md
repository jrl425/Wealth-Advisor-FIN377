# Research Question
## Bigger Question
The broader issue at hand is the increasing responsibility on individuals to manage their retirement savings effectively, amidst a backdrop of volatile markets, unlimited investment options, and complex tax implications. With wealth managers and financial advisors taking 1% of client wealth every year, there is a growing need for tools that can simplify wealth management and retirement preparation, empowering individuals to make informed investment decisions.
## Specific Research Questions
- How can we provide individual investors with a personalized, optimal investment portfolio that aligns with their retirement goals, risk tolerance, and market outlook, without the need for a financial advisor?
- What are the impacts of including non-traditional investment options (such as ESG, cryptocurrency, and real estate) in retirement portfolios, across different levels of risk aversion?
- Can an automated system effectively predict and adjust an individual's investment strategy over time, to maximize retirement savings while minimizing tax implications?
Our project does not necessarily fit into the usual prediction or analysis models. Instead, it uses a dashboard to run simulations based on what users input, showing them how different investment choices could play out over time in a straightforward and interactive way.
